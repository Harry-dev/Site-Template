UPDATES LOG - current version 3.0.1 -->
- CRITICAL -
	1.0: Tie as close to Underswell as possible - this template should be a customized extension of underswell, not a replacement

	<!-- 1.0: Build 3.0 to work alongside Bootstrap 4
		1.1: And therefore also be built in SASS -->

	1.0: Fully mobile-first
		1.1: Rewrite template to be mobile-first-friendly and reinforce habits



- SUPERFICIAL -
	1.0: More useful demo page - show actual use-case scenario modules [use a vader css sheet so as to keep core template clean]

		1.2: Floating Swatches button
		<!-- 1.3: Snippets - Bootstrap Accordion, with example + code -->
		1.4: Various Button animations

		1.6: Tooltips

- PERFORMANCE/UNDER THE HOOD -
	1.0: Remove Clutter
		<!-- 1.1: Remove excess/plugin JS, CSS, and Vendor files/folders -->
		1.2: Fix wp_enqueue to make optimal use of the remaining plugins and frameworks (+ actually figure out how it works)

	1.0: Remove double-ups
		1.1: A lot of the functionality of the template is already controllable via bootstrap, avoid doubling up
